*Library Management System Documentation*
Introduction
The Library Management System is a software application developed to automate and streamline the operations of a library. It provides an intuitive graphical user interface for librarians and staff members to manage books, track borrowing activities, and maintain the overall library status. This documentation aims to explain the project's purpose, features, and the decision-making process behind its design.

Features and Functionality
The Library Management System offers the following key features:

Book Management:

Add Books: Librarians can add new books to the library by providing the book ID, name, and category. The system ensures unique book IDs and validates the information.
Remove Books: Unwanted or outdated books can be removed from the library by specifying the book ID.
Categorized Books: The system categorizes books into five predefined categories: Biology, Maths, History, Chemistry, and Politics.
Borrowing and Returning:

Borrow Books: Users can borrow books from the library by entering the book ID and the desired borrowing period. The system validates the book availability and tracks the borrowing details.
Return Books: Borrowed books can be returned to the library by providing the book ID. The system updates the book's availability and records the return transaction.
Library Status:

View Library Status: The system provides an overview of the library's current status, including the total number of borrowed books and the count of books in each category.
Design and Implementation
User Interface:
The Library Management System utilizes a graphical user interface (GUI) implemented with the Swing framework in Java. This choice ensures a user-friendly experience with intuitive buttons and input dialogs for various operations.

Class Structure:
The project consists of two main classes: Library and LibraryGui.

Library Class:

The Library class represents the library entity and encapsulates its attributes and behaviors.
The class includes a capacity attribute to specify the maximum number of books the library can hold.
Book objects are stored in an ArrayList to allow efficient book management operations.
The class provides methods for adding, removing, borrowing, returning, and viewing the library status.
LibraryGui Class:

The LibraryGui class extends the JFrame class and serves as the main user interface for interacting with the library system.
It implements the ActionListener interface to handle user actions triggered by buttons in the GUI.
The class instantiates a Library object to perform library operations.
Each button in the GUI is associated with an action listener to execute the corresponding functionality.
Workflow
Execution:

Upon launching the executable file, the Library Management System GUI appears.
The user can interact with the GUI to perform various operations.
Adding a Book:

Clicking the "Add Book" button prompts the user to enter the book's ID, name, and select a category from the dropdown menu.
The system validates the input, adds the book to the library, and displays a success or failure message.
Removing a Book:

Clicking the "Remove Book" button asks the user to enter the book's ID.
The system checks the validity of the ID, removes the book if found, and provides appropriate feedback.
Borrowing a Book:

Clicking the "Borrow Book" button requires the user to input the book's ID and the desired borrowing period.
The system validates the book availability and records the borrowing transaction accordingly.
Returning a Book:

Clicking the "Return Book" button prompts the user to enter the book's ID.
The system verifies the book's status, updates its availability, and marks it as returned.
Viewing Library Status:

Clicking the "View Library Status" button displays an overview of the library's current status, including borrowed book counts and category information.
Exit:

The user can close the Library Management System GUI to terminate the application.
Decision-Making Process
GUI Approach:

The decision to use a graphical user interface was made to enhance usability and provide a visually appealing experience for library staff.
The Swing framework in Java was chosen due to its extensive functionality and platform independence.
Categorized Books:

To facilitate efficient book management and organization, the decision was made to categorize books into predefined categories.
This enables users to quickly browse books based on their interests or study areas, improving the overall library experience.
Validation and Feedback:

Input validation mechanisms were implemented to ensure data integrity and provide informative feedback messages to users.
This helps prevent errors and guides users through the library management process.
Object-Oriented Design:

The project adopts an object-oriented design approach to encapsulate data and behaviors within classes.
This promotes code modularity, reusability, and maintainability.
Conclusion
The Library Management System project provides an efficient and user-friendly solution for managing library operations. It offers essential features such as book management, borrowing, returning, and viewing the library status. The system's design decisions, including the GUI implementation, book categorization, and input validation, were made to optimize usability, data organization, and code maintainability. By utilizing this software, library staff can streamline their workflows, enhance book management efficiency, and provide better service to library users.
